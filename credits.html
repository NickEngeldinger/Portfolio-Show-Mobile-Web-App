		<p>I created this app using the Beta 2 version of jQuery Mobile, HTML5, CSS3 and some good old fashioned hard work. I coded it in Vim on Ubuntu, utilized Git for version control and the source code can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/NickEngeldinger/Portfolio-Show-Mobile-Web-App">Github</a>.  My hope is that the app will be useful for the portfolio show attendees not only during the show but later as a tool to look up a graduate's information. There are many bright, hard working and ambitious students in the summer class of 2011 and I am proud to be graduating alongside them. I would like to take the oppurtunity to thank two of my instructors whom without their wisdom and dedication I would have never developed an app like this. Griff Walker and Peter Wooley taught me, guided me, supported me and inspired me. This app is not so much a demonstration of what I can do as it is a demonstration of the high level of instruction offered by these gentlemen.</p>

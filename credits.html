                <h2>Hi I'm Nick Engeldinger</h2>
		<p>I created this app using the Beta 2 version of jQuery Mobile, HTML5, CSS3 and some good old fashioned hard work. I coded it in Vim on Ubuntu, utilized Git for version control and the source code can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/NickEngeldinger/Portfolio-Show-Mobile-Web-App">Github</a>.  My hope is that the app will be useful for the portfolio show attendees not only during the show but later as a tool to look up a graduate's information. There are many bright, hard working and ambitious students in the summer class of 2011 and I am proud to be graduating alongside them. I would like to take the oppurtunity to thank two of my instructors whom without their wisdom and dedication I would have never developed an app like this. Griff Walker and Peter Wooley taught me, guided me, supported me and inspired me. Thanks a lot gentlemen.</p>
		<p>The application was born out of my professional portfolio and development class which prepares us for the portfolio show. You can meet the people that helped guide the design and development of this project <a href="class.html">here</a>.</p>

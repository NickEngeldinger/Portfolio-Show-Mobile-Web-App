				<h3>Cliburn, James</h3>
				<p>"James Cliburn is a designer that works within the print and digital mediums, using them both to help create designs that fit with a client’s needs. This has also given him the skills needed to help a client develop their identity and help promote their brand through print collateral and the web. His main goal is to create designs that are high in quality, usable, accessible, and memorable. He is also an accomplished illustrator, drawing inspiration from the formal beauty of Modernism and the absurd thoughtfulness of Superflat – creating a unique style that has been described has having the same elegance found in 1960s cereal box designs. This is what drives James Cliburn as a person: to be quirky and fun but never losing the professionalism expected of a career creative.  You can check out a selection of his work at jamescliburn.com – but make sure you stop by to see him while you’re at the Graduation Show!"</p>

				<h3>Rankin, Brandon</h3>
				<p>With a creative mom and a techie dad, you could say I was bred to be a graphic designer. I have a knack for vector art as well as a unique perspective on package design based on my time spent as a costume and prop designer. My design is made effective by both my creativity and my problem solving skills. I take each project as an opportunity to improve myself and move from being a well-rounded student to an outstanding graphic designer.<br /> &#8211; Brandon Rankin

                                <p>I am an extraordinary and confident woman living in integrity.</p>
				<p>For me, every design opportunity is as much about the process as the end result. Covering a multitude of design vernacular, I enjoy experimenting with media or methods that are new to me. Ultimately, the work I deliver is steady, deliberate, and has been nurtured from start to finish.</p>
